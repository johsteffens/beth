Running notes about beth development.

## Distinction of beth from other oop-languages: (June 2017) ## 

    * reflective (type structure is known at runtime)

    * all types are final (!)
      --> no virtual types
      --> no inheritance
      --> no type casting (except from an anonymous type)
      --> but: members of composite types can be of static or variable type

    * Anonymous types
      A type can contain anonymous types.
      -> the actual type is stored in a variable
      -> the variable can be owned by the enclosing type (typed objects)
      -> the variable can be owned by the type itself (aware types)

    * C-programs: type safety checked at runtime (--> not all type errors can be detected, though --> still careful programming required)
    * beth-programs: type safety checked at compile time as best as possible

    * Perspectives are stateless
    * Interfaces are perspectives
    * Operators (on composite-types) would be perspectives
    * The perspective is a new programming paradigm located between OOP and procedural programming
    * Perspectives can implement concepts once in a generic way (which would require a design pattern in other languages)
    * Concepts are easily interchangeable (e.g. different ways of marshaling)

## Cuckoo Hashing ## (experiments of 30 June 2017)
    2 stage vs 3 or higher stage hashing:
    - 2 stage achieves near 50% memory efficiency
    - 3 stage achieves near 90% memory efficiency
    - 3 stage can be several orders of magnitude slower than 2 stage when approaching the occupation limit.
        The extra storage space does not seem justify the storage CPU overhead.

  Hash functions (2 stage)
    LCG mapping:
      Simple lcg mapping for the key value is fastest but provides poor statistics to achieve
      desired storage efficiency (EFF around 6% at 2^16).

    XSG mapping:
      (32 bit) xsg mapping is significantly better than LCG.
      Statistical deficiency begins showing when the database size exceeds about 2^16 entries.
      Space 2^16 : Eff. 45%
      Space 2^26 : Eff. 20%
      Space 2^29 : Eff. 10%

    Fold-hashing:
      Iterative 8 or 16 bit folding seems even better. (1-time 32 bit is not working well)
      FNV can be used but it seems that any form hash = ( hash ^ data ) * <prime> with large enough prime and
      large enough initial seems to work equally well. Preferably choose initial=const such that 
      hash = ( hash ^ <const> ) * <prime> performs a full cycle.

      Space 2^29 : Eff. 43%
      Space 2^30 : Eff. 45%
   
   --> cuckoo hashing with minimal two-stage fold-hashing seems best
   --> hmap shall be based on that concept


## Amoebic Functions (July 17, 2017) ## 

    Amoeba (-Function)
      We introduce the term "amoeba" for a function-abstraction representing class of functions,
      which signature is defined by an object passed by reference. We call this object nucleus.
      The terms are borrowed from the biological term amoeba as being a organism without predefined shape.

      The nucleus is owned/managed by the caller. 
      
      From the viewpoint of the language the signature of an amoeba is fixed
      void (*)( void* ptr_to_nucleus ).

      From the viewpoint of the program the function's signature and purpose is defined by the nucleus.
      It contains fields used as arguments and fields for the return values. The amoeba is a simple way to
      use functions as first class objects in languages that do not provide this feature natively.

    Amoebic representation of a feature (Amoebic feature)
      The amoebic feature describes a feature implementation where its fulfillment is spread
      across two functions, one on the object side and one on the perspective-side. One of these is
      an amoebic function, which controls the fulfillment. The function pointer points to the non-amoebic
      function.

      The nucleus of the amoebic feature has a well defined structure composed in this order: a function pointer, 
      a perspective pointer, the list of arguments of the non-amoebic feature, return object/value 
      (can be omitted when function returns void).
