/** Stable singular value decomposition for a general mxn-matrix a -> a'.
 *  Method: Bi-diagonalization by givens rotations and QR-chasing with stabilized implicit shift.
 *          (Variant of Golub-Reinsch-Algorithm)
 *
 *      * Supports any n,m configuration
 *      * Supports full and thin decomposition.
 *      * Automatically detects and exploits sparsity
 *
 *  It is a = u * a' * vT, with u, v being unitary. Supports full and thin decomposition.
 *  If matrices u, v are desired, their size has to be preset but they need not be preinitialized.
 *  The routine does not change the actual allocation of either matrix, hence u, a, v may
 *  safely reference external data.
 *  Whether full or thin decomposition is computed depends on how matrices have been preset:
 *
 *     a:  mxn input matrix to be diagonalized
 *
 *     u:
 *         NULL         -  u is not computed
 *         mxm matrix   -  full decomposition
 *         mxn matrix   -  thin decomposition for n < m
 *
 *     v:
 *         NULL         -  v is not computed
 *         nxn matrix   -  full decomposition
 *         nxm matrix   -  thin decomposition for m < n
 *
 *  If thin decomposition is chosen, then a' is returned as (thin) square matrix.
 *  Meaning either a->rows or a->cols is changed to min(m,n) by the routine.
