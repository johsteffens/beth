# About Beth

*Beth* is a personal project representing my current interests in software design. 

In it I am re-thinking polymorphism and reflection-aided generic programming. One goal is developing a paradigm in which frequently used design patterns can be
efficiently yet more generally realized than by the traditional object oriented approach. The ultimate (admittedly ambitious) goal is designing a new software 
framework which optimally leverages efficient application design with respect to scalability, maintainability and genericity.

## Concepts

Current focus is implementing a paradigm, called *Perspective*, which I initially conceived in May 2017.

Some of its objectives are...
   * Bridging the gap between procedural and object oriented programming.
   * Reducing interdependencies and enhancing flexibility in maintaining and extending code.
   * Providing the framework for reflection-base generic software design.
   * Dynamic type binding.
   * Binding interfaces and objects via associations.
   * Achieving high runtime efficiency.

This project explores how and to which extend above objectives are achievable.

## License Status

This project is under development. Once the code structure has sufficiently settled, Iâ€™ll decide about a public license. 
For the time being: If you wish to use/copy/fork/integrate all or parts of it (other than granted by Git Hub), please contact me for a personal license. - Thank you.
