# About Beth

*Beth* is a private project representing my personal interest in researching and developing software.
A special focus is finding new useful architecture techniques/design patterns optimally incorporating
reflection, polymorphism, generic programming and other areas.

The ultimate (admittedly ambitious) goal is designing a new architecture and framework to optimally
leverage application design with respect to scalability, maintainability and genericity.
